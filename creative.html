                            When I was young, my dad was constantly working around the
                            house doing repairs, renovating, or building something from
                            scratch. One day, he had some extra wood from a previous
                            project and asked if my siblings and I would like a
                            playhouse. Of course we did! This is where my interest in
                            building and creating began. I sat and watched him as he
                            worked with different tools. I asked what he was doing
                            and why he was doing it. As he worked, he took the time
                            to explain the entire process. This is the most critical
                            part of the learning process for me. I want to see how it's
                            done from someone that has experience and to get the
                            explanation, reasoning behind it.

                                    I continued to watch and learn the process
                                    as my dad worked on things, so that I could
                                    begin building too. Another project my dad
                                    decided to undertake was a birdhouse for the
                                    tree in our front yard. I was still too young to use the power tools, so my dad
                                    showed me how to
                                    measure the wood and use the chalk reel to mark
                                    what needed to be cut. I carefully watched how
                                    he would position the wood and the tools as he
                                    made the cuts. He showed me how to assemble the
                                    pieces and this time I was able to use a hammer
                                    to nail it all together.

                                    As I entered high school, I wanted to continue
                                    learning how to build, which led me to take a
                                    woodshop class. I learned more of the basics
                                    and how to properly use the power tools. The
                                    teacher showed us, step-by-step, how to work with
                                    the wood. Each class involved learning from
                                    instruction first, then we would be given
                                    opportunity to practice that skill. We worked with
                                    the direction of the teacher to make a cutting
                                    board and a Christmas reindeer. The hands-on
                                    practice given in these classes solidified the
                                    skills necessary to continue building and creating
                                    projects on my own.

                                <p> As I have become an adult, the desire to build and
                                    create has never gone away. When I moved to Colorado
                                    7 years ago, my dad gave me a battery powered drill
                                    and skill saw. I had a friend that was moving and
                                    was getting rid of wooden bed slats used for a
                                    platform bed. I realized this could be a good
                                    opportunity to make something out of nothing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As I started brainstorming, I came up with the idea
                                    to build an entryway bench for my apartment. I had
                                    not built anything like this before, so I started by
                                    searching Pinterest to find design ideas. I also used
                                    YouTube instructional videos to figure out exactly how
                                    to put it together. All the skills I had learned from
                                    when I was a child and teenager had not been forgotten.
                                    I remembered the basics and the process I needed to follow.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After the entryway bench, I made a bench
                                    for my parents front yard, wall d√©cor for
                                    my house, a side table for my living room,
                                    and a Christmas decoration.
