                            Hello! My name is Sara Ibarra. I grew up
                            in a small town in Arizona, where most people stay
                            forever. I was always the one that wanted
                            to experience more and move beyond what
                            was comfortable. I moved to Colorado 7 years
                            ago and fell in love with the state. I
                            worked a few places that were stepping
                            stones for what was to come. I finally
                            found a position with Ford Credit in July
                            2019 and felt like this was the career for
                            me. When I am not at work, I enjoy spending
                            time watching football (Go Cardinals!),
                            kayaking, baking, coaching,
                            and making some sort of craft. One of the ways
                            life remains full, exciting, healthy for me is
                            to create. One of my favorite things to do is
                            to take something that was going to be thrown
                            out and turn it into something new. I have always
                            been a self-learner and have become good friends
                            with YouTube and Pinterest. I learned how to make
                            everything from a cheesecake to a side table.
                            My desire is to grow in the freedom to continue
                            taking my own thoughts, ideas, designs, and turning
                            them into reality, so that one day others are using
                            my Pinterest and YouTube channels as their examples.

                    <div class="box-child-element">
                        <div class="box2">
                            <h2 class="boxheader">The Why</h2>
                            Entering into the field of software engineering
                            provides me with endless opportunities to create.
                            As I said previously, what motivates me in life is
                            having an outlet to express myself. This marries
                            perfectly with Ford's future goals. Marion Harris
                            has said, "We need to start thinking of ourselves
                            as a software company more than a finance company."
                            I want to be part of Ford Credit for many years to
                            come. I want to grow with the company and be a part
                            of the transformation from thinking like a finance
                            company to becoming a software company.
                            <br>
                            After these last six weeks, I discovered that part
                            of being a software engineer involves constant
                            problem-solving, research, and creativity to identify
                            the code that needs correction in order to bring the
                            project to life. This is very similar to my learning
                            process, as outlined under
                            <a href="/Creative.html">"My Passion".</a>
                            As I progressed through the project, I came to realize that this kind
                            of work excites me and motivates me to reach the finish
                            line. I look forward to using my creativity to help Ford
                            evolve in the field of technology!
